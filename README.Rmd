## What this package is for
`rankcomp` compares groups using rank-based methods when data may be skewed, have outliers, or unequal variances. It provides all-pairs rank tests (Steel–Dwass–Critchlow–Fligner), clear effect sizes (probability of superiority), and simple checks so users can decide whether two groups are not just different but close enough to count as the same in practice via equivalence/non-inferiority. Outputs are tidy tables for easy reporting.

## Installation
```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("oliviarmarcum1/rankcomp")
```

## Minimal example
```r
library(rankcomp)
set.seed(1)
x <- c(rnorm(10,0), rnorm(12,0.6), rnorm(9,0))
g <- factor(rep(c("A","B","C"), c(10,12,9)))

pairwise_rank_sum(x, g)
np_effect_size(x, g, measure = "auc", ci = TRUE, nboot = 200, seed = 1)
equivalence_np(x, g, delta = 0.05, measure = "auc",
               alternative = "equivalence", nboot = 200, seed = 1)

```
